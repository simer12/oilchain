# 🎯 Problem Statement → Solution Mapping

## Your Original Problem Statement

**Challenge**: India imports 55-60% of its oilseed requirement despite being the world's largest vegetable oil consumer, creating dependency on volatile global markets. To achieve the target of 69M tonnes by 2030-31, we need to address systemic inefficiencies.

---

## 7 Core Problems Identified

### 1. ❌ IMPORT DEPENDENCY (55-60%)
**Root Cause**: Low domestic production (32M tonnes vs. 69M target)
- Poor yield (1.8 t/ha vs global 2.5 t/ha)
- Outdated farming practices
- Lack of quality seeds & inputs

### 2. ❌ SUPPLY CHAIN LOSSES (20%)
**Root Cause**: Inadequate logistics & storage infrastructure
- Post-harvest losses: 15%
- Transport losses: 3%
- Storage wastage: 2%
- Annual loss: ₹8,000+ Crores

### 3. ❌ FARMER EXPLOITATION
**Root Cause**: Information asymmetry & middlemen monopoly
- Middlemen capture 30-40% of consumer price
- Farmers get only 60-70% of final price
- No access to real market data
- Limited bargaining power

### 4. ❌ POOR PRICE DISCOVERY
**Root Cause**: No real-time market information system
- Farmers unaware of market prices
- Price manipulation by middlemen
- No transparent pricing mechanism
- High volatility (10-20% swings)

### 5. ❌ UNCONTROLLED PEST OUTBREAKS
**Root Cause**: No early warning or monitoring system
- Pest damage: 10-20% of production
- Reactive approach (manage after outbreak)
- No data-driven prevention
- No community alerts

### 6. ❌ WAREHOUSE MISMANAGEMENT
**Root Cause**: Manual tracking, poor infrastructure
- Storage inefficiency
- Inadequate cold chain (only 5% of requirement)
- Inventory mismanagement
- Temperature/humidity uncontrolled

### 7. ❌ LIMITED TRACEABILITY
**Root Cause**: Fragmented supply chain, no accountability
- Quality unverified through supply chain
- No batch tracking
- Consumer trust issues
- Insurance claims difficult
